Your schema objects should posses simple, but description names. Schema objects should begin as simple meaningful nouns, but can be also decorated with verbs that speak to what is being set in motion with each API requests.

You should avoid using request and response in your API schema names, leaving the access of your schema in the naming of each API operation, and focusing on what submitted using request bodies, and returned via each response.

We look for intuitive and reusable schema names, that will allow schema to be effectively used across many APIs, and make sense as a collection of objects. We feel the schema names should stand on their own as part of your overall API narrative.
