The OpenAPI specification provides an effective way to communicate what an operation does in as few words as possible with the operation summary property. The operation summary should be short and concise, reflect the resources being made available.

The OpenAPI description property is where you will get more verbose with the narrative for each API operation, but the summary should be as few words as possible. Summaries are where we look for evidence that APIs are more than just Create, Read, Update, and Delete, CRUD.
