Your API will change, and communicating this change with consumers will help make change something everyone will celebrate and benefit from. The OpenAPI specification makes it easy for you to communicate the changes of your API using the info version property.

When reviewing APIs we are always looking at the ways you can effectively communicate change using semantic or date-based versioning, and the info version property is where this search begins. It doesn't matter which approach you choose, just stick with it, and be as consistent as you can.
