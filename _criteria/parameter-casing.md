We tend to not care what case you use for your query parameters, but we do look for consistency in the case you use. Camel case, snake case, or pascal case, you choose, and we make sure it is consistently applied.

If you do not have opinions, we generally look at what you have applied across the OpenAPIs you've provided, and we will make a recommendation about what to do moving forward. Our goal is consistency over there being a "right" way of how you provide parameter controls for your APIs.
